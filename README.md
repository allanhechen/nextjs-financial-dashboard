# nextjs-financial-dashboard

This repository consists of me going through the [Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app).

-   I will be trying to incorporate best software development practices such as development practices (like branching and ~~pull requests~~ this one is kind of useless) despite being the only person working on this project
-   I will dockerize this workspace in an attempt to facilitate easy contribution (I have given up on this for now, it appears that the db object requires some fields I am not familiar with).

    ## Contributing

    Contributions are welcome! I am learning as I go along, however I will probably follow the Next.js examples fairly closely to get an idea of what's going on.

    In order to contribute, set up your development environment as follows:

    -   [x] Install Docker
    -   [x] Install the [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) VSCode extension
    -   [x] Hit <code>CTRL + SHIFT + P</code> and select "reopen in container"
