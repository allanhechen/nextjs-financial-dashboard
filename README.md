# nextjs-financial-dashboard

This repository consists of me going through the [Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app).

- I will be trying to incorporate best software development practices such as development practices (like branching and pull requests) despite being the only person working on this project
- I will dockerize this workspace in an attempt to facilitate easy contribution (I hope no one ever reads this lol)

  ## Contributing

  Contributions are welcome! I am learning as I go along, however I will probably follow the Next.js examples fairly closely to get an idea of what's going on.

  In order to contribute, set up your development environment as follows:
  - [X] Install Docker
  - [X] Install the [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) VSCode extension
  - [X] Hit <code>CTRL + SHIFT + P</code> and select "reopen in container"
